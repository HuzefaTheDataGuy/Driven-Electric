    Tesla’s sales fell in several European markets in March, according to data published by Reuters. The news agency reports that the new figures add signs that drivers are turning away from Elon Musk’s electric car brand as competition from Chinese car manufacturers increases and some protest his political views.  
    <br> Tesla’s quarterly sales fell by around 62 percent in Germany, 55 percent in Sweden and Denmark, almost 50 percent in the Netherlands, and 41 percent in France. The United Kingdom continues to be Tesla's biggest market in Europe and was the only country in the continent to see a sales increase in the first quarter of 2025 (+3.5 percent). Nevertheless, Tesla's share of the UK market fell by more than 4 percentage points to 10.7 percent last month, partly due to increased competition from other manufacturers in a rapidly growing market (the country recorded record electric vehicle sales in the first quarter).
